Package `JuliaCall` is an R interface to `Julia`, 
which is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language
for numerical computing, see <https://julialang.org/> for more information.
Below is an image for [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
JuliaCall brings **more than 100 times speedup** of the calculation!
See <https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/example/mandelbrot> for more information.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

## Installation

To use package `JuliaCall`, you first have to install [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) on your computer. You can download a generic binary from 
<https://julialang.org/downloads/> and add it to your path, and then you can install `JuliaCall` just like any other R packages by
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("JuliaCall")
```

Currently `Julia v0.6.x`, `Julia v1.0.x`, and `Julia v1.1` are all supported by `JuliaCall`.

You can get the development version of `JuliaCall` by
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall")
```

## Basic Usage

Before using `JuliaCall`, you need to do initial setup by function `julia_setup()` for automatic type conversion, Julia display systems, etc. 
It is necessary for every new R session to use the package.
If not carried out manually, it will be invoked automatically before other `julia_xxx` functions.
Solutions to some common error in `julia_setup()` are documented in the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-and-way-to-get-help).

```{r}
library(JuliaCall)
julia <- julia_setup()

## If you want to use `Julia` at a specific location, you could do the following:
## julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains Julia binary").
## You can also set JULIA_HOME in command line environment or use `options(...)`.

## Different ways of using Julia to calculate sqrt(2)

# julia$command("a = sqrt(2);"); julia$eval("a")
julia_command("a = sqrt(2);"); julia_eval("a")
julia_eval("sqrt(2)")
julia_call("sqrt", 2)
julia_eval("sqrt")(2)
julia_assign("x", sqrt(2)); julia_eval("x")
julia_assign("rsqrt", sqrt); julia_call("rsqrt", 2)
2 %>J% sqrt

## You can use `julia$exists` as `exists` in R to test
## whether a function or name exists in Julia or not

julia_exists("sqrt")
julia_exists("c")

## Functions related to installing and using Julia packages

julia_install_package_if_needed("Optim")
julia_installed_package("Optim")
julia_library("Optim")
```

## Troubleshooting and Ways to Get Help

### Julia is not found

Make sure the `Julia` installation is correct.
`JuliaCall` can find `Julia` on PATH,
and there are three ways for `JuliaCall` to find `Julia` not on PATH.

- Use `julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia binary")`
- Use `options(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia binary")`
- Set `JULIA_HOME` in command line environment.

### libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.xx' not found

Such problems are usually on Linux machines.
The cause for the problem is that R cannot find the libstdc++ version needed by `Julia`.
To deal with the problem, users can export "TheFolderContainsJulia/lib/julia" to R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

### How to Get Help

- One way to get help for Julia functions is just using `julia$help` as the following example:

```{r}
julia_help("sqrt")
```

- The GitHub Pages for this repository host the documentation for the development version of `JuliaCall`: <https://non-contradiction.github.io/JuliaCall/>.

- Also, you are more than welcome to contact me about `JuliaCall` at <lch34677@gmail.com> or <cxl508@psu.edu>.

## JuliaCall for R Package Developers

If you are interested in developing an `R` package which is an interface for
a `Julia` package, `JuliaCall` is an ideal choice.
You only need to find the `Julia` function or `Julia` module you want to have in `R`, `using` the module, and `julia_call` the function.
There are some examples:

- [`diffeqr`](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/diffeqr) is a package for solving differential equations in `R`. It utilizes [DifferentialEquations.jl](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/) for its core routines to give high performance solving of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), stochastic differential equations (SDEs), delay differential equations (DDEs), and differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) directly in `R`.
- [`convexjlr`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/convexjlr) is an `R` package for Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) by providing a high level wrapper for `Julia` package [`Convex.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl). `convexjlr` can solve linear programs, second order cone programs, semidefinite programs, exponential cone programs, mixed-integer linear programs, and some other DCP-compliant convex programs through `Convex.jl`.
- [`ipoptjlr`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/ipoptjlr) provides an `R` interface to the `Ipopt` nonlinear optimization solver. It provides a simple high-level wrapper for `Julia` package [`Ipopt.jl`] (https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Ipopt.jl).
- [`FixedEffectjlr`](https://github.com/eloualiche/FixedEffectjlr) uses the `Julia` package [`FixedEffectModels.jl`](https://github.com/matthieugomez/FixedEffectModels.jl) to estimate large fixed effects models in `R`.
- [Julia MixedModels from R](http://rpubs.com/dmbates/377897) illustrates how to use `JuliaCall` and `Julia` package [`MixedModels.jl`](https://github.com/dmbates/MixedModels.jl) to build mixed models in `R`.
- [`autodiffr`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/autodiffr) provides automatic differentiation to native `R` functions by wrapping `Julia` packages [`ForwardDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) and [`ReverseDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl) through `JuliaCall`, which is a work in progress.

If you have any issues in developing an `R` package using `JuliaCall`,
you may report it using the link: <https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/issues/new>, or email me at <lch34677@gmail.com> or <cxl508@psu.edu>.

## Suggestion, Issue Reporting, and Contributing

`JuliaCall` is under active development now.
Any suggestion or issue reporting is welcome!
You may report it using the link: <https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/issues/new>, or email me at <lch34677@gmail.com> or <cxl508@psu.edu>.
You are welcome to use the [issue template](.github/issue_template.md)
and the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md).
The [contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides some guidance for making contributions.

### Checking `JuliaCall` Package

To check and test the `JuliaCall` package, you need to have the source package. You can 

- download the source of `JuliaCall` from Github,
- open `JuliaCall.Rproj` in your RStudio or open `R` from the downloaded directory,
- run `devtools::test()` to see the result of the test suite.
- run `devtools::check()` or click the `Check` button in the RStudio Build panel in the upper right to see the result of `R CMD check`.

## Other Interfaces Between R and Julia

- [`RCall.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl) is a `Julia` package which embeds `R` in `Julia`. `JuliaCall` is inspired by `RCall.jl` and depends on `RCall.jl` for many functionalities like type conversion between `R` and `Julia`.
- [`XRJulia`](https://github.com/johnmchambers/XRJulia) is an `R` package based on John Chambers' `XR` package and allows for structured integration of `R` with `Julia`. It connects to `Julia` and uses JSON to transfer data between `Julia` and `R`. A simple performance comparison between `XRJulia` and `Julia` can be found in [`JuliaCall` JOSS paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01284).
- [`RJulia`](https://github.com/armgong/rjulia) is an `R` package which embeds `Julia` in `R` as well as `JuliaCall`. It is not on CRAN yet, and I haven't tested it.
